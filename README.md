Triple-A: Analysis and Visual Exploration of Households' Energy Consumption
==========

[Triple-A](http://triple-a-interreg.eu) is a EU-INTERREG project aiming at reducing CO2 emissions in Europe by generating awareness in homeowners about households carbon footprint. In this context, we develop an interactive dashboard using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com), in order to show homeowners their **energy consumption patterns**.

The dashboard uses data collected from a house in the north of France during 1-year. The data and the cleaning process details are availables in the [data-analysis](https://github.com/javieraespinosa/TripleA-household-energy-analysis/tree/master/data-analysis) folder.

This work was the basis for the [GreenHome](https://github.com/javieraespinosa/TripleA-household-energy-analysis/blob/master/GreenHome.pdf) master thesis.
